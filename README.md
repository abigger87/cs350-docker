## Intro

This repo contains a simple dev environment to do operating system development
(at least for xv6). After pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub, you
should be able to use the `run.sh` script to start, stop, and work in a
virtualized environment all from your command line.

The interface is based off of [Noah Kim's](https://github.com/noahbkim) [cs104/docker](https://github.com/csci104/docker).

For more information, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/camerondurham/cs350-docker/wiki). For any bugs or problems, please [create an issue](https://github.com/camerondurham/cs350-docker/issues/new/choose).

### Supported Platforms

This Docker image has been tested and verified to be functioning correctly on the following platforms:

- Catalina, Big Sur (Intel)
- Big Sur (Apple Silicon)
- Windows 10 (Docker with WSL2 backend)

## Quick Start

You can download the CLI utility to run this and other docker environments. Shameless plug, I wrote that CLI too.
Benefits of installing this way is that you don't have to be in a specific directory to start the csci350 environment.
Also, you won't have to clone this repo to get started.

See [instructions here](https://github.com/camerondurham/ch#quick-start) on the commands to run to install the CLI.

Once you have `ch` installed, run the command to [create the csci350 environment](https://github.com/camerondurham/ch#create-the-csci-350-environment).
This will download the Docker image that will work for xv6 and set the required environment to run qemu, gdb,
and even do remote debugging. Before you run the command, make sure you've provided the correct path with the
`--volume` flag (see instructions in the README for details).


## Getting Started

The instructions below will walk you through running the setup script and the run script you'll use to access the csci350 environment.

### Set Up

1. **install Docker** desktop from [the website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

2. **clone this repository**.

3. specify your desired mount location (i.e. your `xv6` project folder)


**Windows users only**

Make sure you run this in an Admin PowerShell to let you run scripts:

```powershell
# must execute this in admin powershell and select [A] to run scripts
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

### Running

1. Modify the `work` variable at the top of the run script in the project folder.
For example:

**macOS/Linux**

```bash
# in run.sh
work=~/projects/cs350/xv6-public-master/
```

**Windows**

```powershell
# in run.ps1
$work="C:\Users\Username\cs350\xv6-public-master"
```

2. Run the `run.sh`/`run.ps1` script. If this is your first time starting, this will
pull the Docker image. This image will be cached until there's a new image
available or you manually remove it.

**macOS/Linux**

```bash
./run.sh start
```

**Windows**

```powershell
.\run.ps1 start
```

This script is only a wrapper for some simple Docker commands.


### Working in the Environment

To start up a Linux shell inside the Docker image, you'll want to start a terminal session inside the Docker image:

**Unix-based Users**:

```shell
./run.sh shell
```

**Windows Users**:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 shell
```

### Stopping

After you're done working in the environment, you might want to shut down the image. Don't worry if you forget to
do this, since Docker Desktop will automatically and safely stop running images when you shutdown your computer.

**Unix-based Users**:

```shell
./run.sh stop
```

**Windows Users**:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 stop
```

## System Requirements

Below are the system requirements for Docker Desktop:

[Windows host](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/):

- Windows 10 64-bit: (Build 15063 or later)
  - Pro, Enterprise, or Education: using Hyper-V and Containers Windows features
  - Any Windows 10 version: using WSL2 container backend **(recommended)**

If you are using Windows 10 Home, you can obtain a "free" license for Windows 10 Education [here](https://viterbiit.usc.edu/services/hardware-software/microsoft-imagine-downloads/).

[Mac host](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/):

- Mac hardware must be a 2010 or newer model
- macOS must be version 10.13 or newer
- 4 GB RAM minimum


## Troubleshooting


### xv6 will not start shell, hangs at qemu command

If you're having issues starting `xv6`, such as the system is hanging at `qemu` commands, try the following

1. outside the Docker shell, pull updated repo directoy from xv6-public: `git clone git@github.com:mit-pdos/xv6-public.git`
2. ensure all `.pl` files are executable and re-build:

```bash
# run these commands in the docker shell
chmod +x *.pl
make clean
make qemu-nox
```

### make qemu fails

Since this Docker image does not run a virtual display or window server, you cannot run `make qemu`. Instead, use
`make qemu-nox`. Adding an X server would have minimal benefit, since you can simply use your current terminal
window to debug your xv6 programs.
